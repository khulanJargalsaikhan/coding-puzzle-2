# coding-puzzle-2

    You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. 
	  Write code to compute the fine you would have to pay. 
	  If your speed is 60 or less, the result is 0 since there is no fine. 
	  If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the fine is 100 dollars. 
	  If speed is 81 or more, the result is 200. 
	  Unless it is a holiday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
	  
	 
	EXPECTATIONS:
	speedingFine(60, false) --- 0 
	speedingFine (65, false) --- 100
	speedingFine (65, true) --- 0
